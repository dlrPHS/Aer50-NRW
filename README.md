# German Public Building Section Dataset (GPUB)

GPUB includes aerial data publicly provided by the opengeodata initiative of the government of the federal state of North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

GPUB is created because there is a lack of public building instance segmentation datasets that also contain digital surface model (DSM) information. GPUB contributes to the developement of multi-modal building detection methods by deep learning methods.
